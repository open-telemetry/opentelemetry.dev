OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are
designed for the creation and management of _telemetry data_ such as traces,
metrics, and logs. This documentation page is intended to broadly cover key
terms, concepts, and instructions on how to use OpenTelemetry in your software.
