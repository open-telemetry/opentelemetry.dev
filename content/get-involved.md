# Code of Conduct  
OpenTelemetry follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

# Registry
Do you maintain or contribute to an integration for OpenTelemetry? We'd love to feature your project in the [registry](/registry)!

To add your project, please make a pull request to the [opentelemetry.io repository on GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io). You'll need to create a data file in `/content/registry` for your project in the following format:

```
---
title: My OpenTelemetry Integration // the name of your project
registryType: <exporter/api/collector/plugin> // the type of integration; is this an exporter, plugin, API package, or something else?
isThirdParty: <false/true> // this is only true if the project is maintained by the OpenTelemetry project
language: <collector/cpp/dotnet/erlang/go/java/js/php/python/etc> // language of your integration
tags:
  - <language>
  - <other useful search terms>
repo: https://github.com/your-organization/your-repo // projects don't have to be hosted on github, but this should link to the git or other source control repository for your project
license: Apache 2.0 // or whatever your OSS license is
description: A friendly description of your integration/plugin
authors: <The author or authors of your integration. An email is a great thing to include!>
otVersion: <The OpenTelemetry version your plugin targets.> 
---
```

Once you've created this data file, make a pull request and we'll add your project to the registry!
