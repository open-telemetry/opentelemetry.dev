This is the index page for a given language. It has an introduction to OpenTelemetry in that language, a section to indicate the maturity of the API/SDK, and links to the repository. If links to other external canonical documentation exist, they should also go here (i.e., API references)

A link to the upstream repository should be prominent in the introduction.
